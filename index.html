                <p>I am a entrepreneur and a aspiring Full Stack Web Developer based in Bangkok, Thailand. I believe that in order to create a truly fulfilling life, one would have to pick up three types of habits: wealth creation, healthy lifestyle, and
                    lifelong learning. I love reading, playing sports, and is creating leverage by learning how to code. My optimistic outlook in life, and a innate growth mindset will be a beneficial addition to any company's culture.</p>

            <h2>My Background</h2>
            <p>I was born on August 2nd 1996 in Bangkok, Thailand to a typical upper-middle class family. I was blessed with opportunities to study in an International School in Thailand, where I was exposed to English, and Chinese at a very young age. I
                went to University of California, Santa Barbara for college, and that was when I started to realize what I want to do with my life. At UCSB, I read a book called "The Alchemist By Paulo Coelho" for one of my Technology Management classes,
                and upon reading that book I felt a calling for entrepreneurship. Shortly after, I started a Ready to Drink Protein Shake Company with another friend in Thailand. At that time there weren't any RTD proteinshakes in Thailand (only powdered
                versions) so we thought it was a good opportunity. However, after 6 months, we failed to handle the cost of production for each proteinshake, and ultimately had to discontinue the pursuit. Two years later, now I started another company
                called "Sasom", which is an authentic marketplace for buying and selling sneakers and collectibles in Thailand, while attending the Lambda School Full Stack Web Development Part Time program. </p>
